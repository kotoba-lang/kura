  "Where shards go — the keystone of ADR-2607299200 section 3.

  **Two levels, not one.** An object does not record which node holds which
  shard. It records which *placement group* it belongs to, and the group
  records the node set:

      object-id --(hash)--> placement group    ; a function, never stored
      placement group --(table)--> node set    ; ~10^5 rows for a petabyte

  Storing shard->node directly costs `objects x n` rows: at 64 MiB objects and
  n=26 that is 420 million rows for one petabyte. That does not fit the one
  ref the query plane gives us, and splitting the ref is exactly what makes
  the repair scheduler's central question — *node N died, which groups are now
  below threshold?* — unanswerable. Through groups it is a scan of ~10^5 rows
  and the answer is a join away.

  **Rendezvous, not a ring.** Group -> node set is highest-random-weight
  hashing: score every node for the group, take the top n. Adding or removing
  a node moves only the placements that node wins or loses — no neighbour
  reshuffle, no ring bookkeeping to keep consistent between coordinator and
  client. Weight is expressed as virtual ids rather than a score multiplier,
  because the usual weighted-HRW formula needs a logarithm and this has to
  stay integer arithmetic a `.kotoba` guest can reproduce exactly.

  **Failure domains beat score.** Selection walks nodes in score order and
  skips any that would exceed a per-domain cap. This is the whole durability
  argument of section 1: the independent-failure model that gets 1.625x to ten
  nines is worth nothing if a rack, an operator or a region can take out more
  shards than the code tolerates. The cap is policy, not a constant, because
  section 1's open question — bonded invite-only versus permissionless — moves
  it and nothing else here.

  Selection is deterministic and total: same node set plus same policy gives
  the same placement on every host, and a group that cannot be filled under
  the cap is reported as underfilled rather than quietly filled anyway."

  rack failure is exactly survivable and `{:rack 8}` means it is not. Nothing

  say the group is short, because a caller that silently accepts n-2 shards
  has silently accepted a different durability than it asked for. Whether to

  Shard i goes to the i-th selected node, i.e. in descending score order. The

  first, then local parities, then global parities, and `select` has already
  spread the whole set across failure domains, so no local group can be wholly
  contained in one domain unless the caps allowed it.

  A variant worth knowing about and NOT implemented here: deliberately
  co-locating each local group inside one domain makes repair a rack-local
  read instead of a cross-rack one, which is the traffic that dominates once
  the network is large. It costs durability in exactly the case the caps are
  there to prevent — losing that domain loses the entire group at once, which
  this code survives (a whole group plus its local parity is 5 shards and
  `erasure` tolerates 7) but with much less margin than a spread placement.
  Choosing it is a real decision with a real price, so it waits for the
