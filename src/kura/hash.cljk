  "The two integer hashes placement is defined in terms of.

  **Why these are specified, not injected.** Everything else in this library
  takes its crypto by injection. Placement cannot: a client, a coordinator and
  an auditor must independently compute the SAME node set for a placement
  group, or the network has no shared notion of where anything lives. A
  pluggable hash would make placement a matter of configuration agreement
  rather than arithmetic, and disagreement would show up as data that is
  simultaneously present and missing. So the functions are pinned here, in
  32-bit arithmetic that a `.kotoba` guest can reproduce exactly.

  32-bit and not 64-bit because the compile path has `i32-wrapping-mul` and
  `xorshift32` but no wrapping 64-bit multiply — a 64-bit mixer would trap on
  overflow. 32 bits is ample: it is a placement dispersion function, not a
  security primitive, and nothing here resists an adversary. Node identity and
  audit challenges are signed and seeded elsewhere.

  Cross-host care: Clojure and ClojureScript disagree about what 32-bit
  arithmetic means (`bit-and` returns a signed int in cljs; longs do not
  overflow at 32 bits in clj), so every operation normalises through `u32`."
