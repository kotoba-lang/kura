  "When to rebuild, in what order, and reading from where.

  The shard-level question — *given these erasures, what do I read* — belongs
  to `erasure.lrc` and is not re-answered here. What this namespace owns is
  everything the code cannot know: which losses are real rather than
  transient, how close a group is to the cliff, and which group to fix first
  when there are more than there is bandwidth for.

  **Grace before repair.** A node that stopped answering thirty seconds ago
  has usually not lost anything. Repairing on first miss turns a rolling
  restart into a network-wide rebuild, and rebuild traffic is the cost the
  whole local-parity design exists to minimise — spending it on nodes that
  are about to come back is the most expensive possible mistake. So a missing
  shard becomes a repairable shard only after `:grace-seconds`, and until then
  the group is *degraded*, which is a different state with a different
  response (serve reads around it, do not move bytes).

  **Margin, not count, sets priority.** Two groups each missing three shards
  are not equally urgent if one of them lost three shards from one local group
  and the other lost three spread out. What matters is how many further losses
  the group survives, which is a question for the code, so `margin` asks it
  by search rather than assuming the worst case applies uniformly."

  decodable regardless of which shards they hit.

  The true margin of a particular pattern can be higher — `erasure`'s measured
  distance says 1,464 of the 1,562,275 eight-shard patterns fail, so most
  eight-shard losses are still fine. Scheduling on the optimistic number would
